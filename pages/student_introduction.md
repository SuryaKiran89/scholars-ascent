# WELCOME TO THE SCHOLAR'S ASCENT
## Student Introduction to ENG302-4B Gamified Experience

---

## WHAT IS THIS?

Welcome to **The Scholar's Ascent**‚Äîa gamified learning experience that transforms your Research Writing course into an epic intellectual journey. 

You're not just completing assignments. You're **ascending Knowledge Mountain**, navigating five distinct territories, earning achievements, and ultimately defending your discoveries before the Council of Masters.

This is the same rigorous academic course with the same learning outcomes and assessments. But now, your progress is visible, your achievements are celebrated, and your journey has narrative meaning.

## HOW IT WORKS

### **YOUR JOURNEY MAP**

Think of your semester as climbing a mountain with five territories:

1. **The Question Plains** (Weeks 1-4)
   - CIA 1: Name your question
   - CIA 2: Gather scholarly voices

2. **The Philosophical Peaks** (Weeks 5-7)
   - CIA 3: Explore your assumptions
   - CIA 4: Choose your philosophical path

3. **The Methodology Maze** (Weeks 8-9)
   - CIA 5: Map your research strategy
   - *[Mid-Summit Checkpoint]*

4. **The Data Wilderness** (Weeks 10-16)
   - Gather data ethically
   - Analyze and interpret
   - Build your Monument (Research Paper)

5. **The Hall of Scholars** (Week 17)
   - Defend your work (Viva Voce)
   - Earn your title

### **YOUR RANK (Leveling System)**

As you complete challenges and earn points, you advance through seven ranks:

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### **Does this change my grade?**
No! Your grade is still based on the same assessments (CIAs, paper, viva) with the same rubrics. The gamification adds:
- Narrative context to your work
- Visible progress tracking
- Achievement recognition
- Optional bonus opportunities through XP

### **Do I have to do side quests?**
No! Side quests are **optional** ways to earn extra XP for unlockable benefits. Your grade doesn't depend on them.

### **What if I don't care about badges?**
That's fine! The badges are for fun and recognition. You can succeed in the course without engaging with the gamification elements‚Äîjust complete your assignments well.

### **Can I lose points or badges?**
No. Progress is only additive. You can't lose rank or badges. However, if you don't meet assignment deadlines or quality standards, you won't earn certain badges.

### **How do I submit side quests?**
Use the **Side Quest Submission Form** (Google Form link provided in class). Submit evidence of completion, and XP will be awarded within 3-5 days.

### **Can guilds compete?**
Yes! Guilds can compete for:
- Best average improvement
- Most side quests completed
- Best collaborative projects

But remember: individual grades are still individual. Guild competition is for fun and community.

### **What if I want to switch guilds?**
Guilds are assigned based on research areas. If your research focus changes significantly, talk to Dr. Surya Kiran about switching.

### **How do I see others' progress?**
The tracker shows everyone's rank, points, and badges. Individual assignment scores remain private.

## A NOTE FROM YOUR GUIDE

*Dear Scholars,*

*Research writing can feel daunting‚Äîabstract concepts, high standards, complex processes. This gamification system isn't meant to trivialize the work (it's still rigorous!). Instead, it's designed to:*

- ***Make your progress visible** ‚Äì You can see how far you've come*
- ***Celebrate achievements** ‚Äì Every milestone deserves recognition*
- ***Add meaning** ‚Äì You're not just "doing assignments," you're on a journey*
- ***Build community** ‚Äì Your guild supports you*
- ***Encourage exploration** ‚Äì Side quests let you go deeper where you're curious*

*The mountain is real. The challenges are real. The achievement is real.*

*But now, you have a map, companions, and markers to show you're moving forward.*

*Will you reach the summit? Let's find out together.*

*‚Äî Dr. Surya Kiran, Your Guide*
